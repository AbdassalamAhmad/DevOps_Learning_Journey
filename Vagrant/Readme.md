# Vagrant Resources

I've used This <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github">"Youtube Course"</a>.<br>

With the help of that course, I've built three virtual machines (VM) on my lab using [this Vagrantfile](https://github.com/AbdassalamAhmad/DevOps_Learning_Journey/blob/main/Vagrant/Vagrantfile).<br>

So, Now I can configure this lab using Ansible to be able to install docker and kuberentes and other tools with one Ansible Playbook without manually install it on every VM or server.


#### I've regularly used these websites for some syntax help.

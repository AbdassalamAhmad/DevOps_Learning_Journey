In every folder I've documented what I've learnt and the resources I've studied from.<br>
So that you can find most important commands and the benefit of every tool I'm using as a **DevOps Engineer.**

## DevOps Tools:
1. [**Docker**](https://github.com/AbdassalamAhmad/DevOps_Learning_Journey/tree/main/Docker): 
    - I've used it to containarize every app alone with its dependencies.
    - The benefit is to be able to run the app without dependencies conflicts.
2. [**Kubernetes (k8s)**](https://github.com/AbdassalamAhmad/DevOps_Learning_Journey/tree/main/Kubernetes): Managing Containerized Applications.
3. [**Ansible**](https://github.com/AbdassalamAhmad/DevOps_Learning_Journey/tree/main/Ansible): Configration Management.
4. **Terraform**: Infrastructure Provisioning.
5. **Grafana {To-Do}**: for Visualization.

## Programming Languages:
1. **Python**: I've used it to automate most repetitive tasks.
2. [**Bash Script**](https://github.com/AbdassalamAhmad/DevOps_Learning_Journey/tree/main/Bash%20Script): I've used it to automate most repetitive tasks.

## Operating System & Source Control:
1. [**Linux**](https://github.com/AbdassalamAhmad/DevOps_Learning_Journey/tree/main/Linux): Since most servers runs on Linux I had to learn these topics.
    - User & File Management : chmod, ls, rm, mkdir, cd, cat, touch,..etc.
    - SSH: connect to tother devices using Secure SHell.
    - Process Managing: kill, start, ps, top,..etc.
    - Text Manipulation Tools: awk, sed, grep, sort, echo,..etc.
    - Network: nmap, ping, netstat,..etc

2. [**Git & GitHub**](https://github.com/AbdassalamAhmad/DevOps_Learning_Journey/tree/main/Git%20%26%20GitHub):
    - I've used it to push code from my local repo to shared repo and roll back whenever I did something wrong, OR if I deleted a file by accident.
    - I've learnt also to pull changes that other developers made to the shared repo.
    - Finally I can make a branch to develop a new feature without affecting the main branch.

## Other Tools:
* [**Vagrant**](https://github.com/AbdassalamAhmad/DevOps_Learning_Journey/tree/main/Vagrant): I've used it to make my own lab of virtual machines to test what I've learnt practically.
